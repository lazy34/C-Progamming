Algorithm to perform Insertion on a linked queue:



 1.Create a new node pointer.
    ptr = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof(struct node));

2.Now, two conditions arise, i.e., either the queue is empty, or the queue contains at least one element.

3. If the queue is empty, then the new node added will be both front and rear, and the next pointer of front and rear will point to NULL.

4.If the queue contains at least one element, then the condition front == NULL becomes false. So, make the next pointer of rear point to new node ptr and point the rear pointer to the newly created node ptr

Hence, a new node(element) is added to the queue.
